VSXu (VSX Ultra) is an OpenGL-based (hardware-accelerated), 
modular programming environment with its main purpose to 
visualize music and create real time graphic effects.

The aim is to bridge the gap between programmer 
and artist and enabling acreative and inspiring 
environment to work in for all parties involved.

VSXu is built on a modular plug-in-based architecture 
so anyone can extend it and or make visualization 
presets ("visuals" or "states").
