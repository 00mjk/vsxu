Note!

If glfw is available in your distribution, please use
that. Otherwise compile it here and insert the files yourself
into /usr/lib and /usr/include.

If you are going to use the fmod module (recommended for 
experimental use only) you have to insert the proper fmod libraries
into /usr/lib found in this directory.
